# Node.js RESTful API Server with AI Integration

This project is a RESTful API server built with Node.js and Express.js. It allows users to create accounts, ask questions, and receive AI-generated answers. The server uses MongoDB as the database and integrates authentication with JWT tokens. The AI response generation is achieved via an external AI API.

## Features
- User Registration and Authentication (JWT)
- Create, Retrieve, and Manage User Profiles
- Submit Questions and Retrieve AI-Generated Answers
- Token-Based Authentication and Refresh Token Support
- Built-in Test Suite using Jest and Supertest
- MongoDB Integration with Mongoose

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (>= 18.x)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance, or MongoDB Memory Server for testing)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bugscreater/Shubham-Pandey-AnswersAi-Backend.git

npm install

# Env Variables
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/answersai
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDq8Xbh3nB4c_OtIkexbM5SsGnt2b61lao

# start the server
npm start

#  The server will start on http://localhost:3000 by default.


#  API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /api/auth/login - Log in a user and return a JWT token.
POST /api/auth/logout - Log out a user.
POST /api/auth/refresh - Refresh the JWT token.
User Management
POST /api/users - Create a new user account.
GET /api/users/:userId - Retrieve a user profile by ID.
GET /api/users/:userId/questions - Retrieve all questions asked by a specific user.
Questions
POST /api/questions - Submit a question and receive an AI-generated answer.
GET /api/questions/:questionId - Retrieve a specific question and its answer.



# Architecture Diagram

# User: The client (user's device or frontend application) initiates API requests to interact with the server, such as registering, logging in, and asking questions.

API Gateway: An API Gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway) serves as the entry point for client requests. It manages routing, throttling, caching, and logging for API calls, adding an extra layer of security by only allowing authorized traffic.

Load Balancer: An Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes incoming API requests across multiple application instances, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.


# Compute:

EC2 Instances or Container Service (ECS): The Node.js application is deployed on either EC2 instances (virtual servers) or an ECS cluster, with multiple instances running the application in containers for isolation, scalability, and efficient resource use. Auto-scaling can be configured to automatically scale instances based on demand.

Lambda (Optional): For specific API calls (like integrating with the AI service), AWS Lambda could be used to run isolated functions without needing a persistent server, reducing costs and improving scalability.

# Database:

MongoDB Atlas (or DynamoDB): The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas, a managed cloud MongoDB service. It provides auto-scaling, high availability, and global distribution for scalability.

Redis Cache (Optional): To speed up repeated requests, Redis can serve as a caching layer for storing frequently requested data, reducing database load and improving response time.


# Authentication and Authorization:

AWS Cognito (or Custom JWT): For secure authentication, AWS Cognito can manage user pools and JWT tokens, while authorizing access to API endpoints based on user roles.

Encryption: Secrets like API keys and JWT tokens are managed securely using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store, ensuring that sensitive information is stored securely.


# AI Service Integration:

GEMINI API: The API integrates with GEMINI API for generating answers to questions. The GEMINI API call is rate-limited and optimized to handle heavy traffic with techniques such as request queuing, caching, and load balancing.

# Logging and Monitoring:

CloudWatch: AWS CloudWatch provides real-time logging, metrics, and alerting to monitor the health of the application and database, track API request volumes, and identify bottlenecks.

X-Ray: For tracing request paths and identifying performance bottlenecks across distributed services.



# CI/CD Pipeline:

AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions: Automates the deployment process, allowing for continuous integration and continuous deployment with tests, build, and deployment stages. It integrates with other AWS services to roll out updates seamlessly.







# Cloud Deployment Process



# Step 1: API Gateway Setup

Configure an API Gateway to handle incoming client requests. Set up endpoints for the /api routes and configure JWT authorization with AWS Cognito or an OAuth provider.

# Step 2: Compute Layer

Option 1: ECS Fargate (Serverless Containers):
    Deploy the Node.js app as a Docker container in ECS using Fargate. This allows for serverless, auto-scaling container orchestration without managing EC2 instances.
    Define a task with the necessary environment variables and secrets managed in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.


Option 2: EC2 Instances (Virtual Machines):

    Set up an EC2 Auto Scaling Group to scale the Node.js application based on traffic. Use the Elastic Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across instances.

# Step 3: Database and Cache

MongoDB Atlas:
   Use MongoDB Atlas for managed, scalable, and globally distributed data storage. Configure backups, replication, and auto-scaling.
Redis Cache:
   Set up Redis on Amazon ElastiCache as a caching layer to reduce database load and improve response time for frequently accessed data.


# Step 4: Security Configuration

Environment Variables:
   Use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store sensitive credentials like the JWT secret, AI API key, and MongoDB credentials.

IAM Roles and Policies:
   Define IAM roles for EC2 instances or ECS tasks with permissions to access necessary resources, like database connections or AI services.
VPC:
   Deploy resources within a VPC to ensure a secure, isolated network environment. Configure Security Groups and Network ACLs to control traffic flow.


# Step 5: CI/CD Setup

Use AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions to automate deployments. Include build steps to run tests, linting, and code quality checks.
Configure deployment stages to update ECS tasks or EC2 instances with zero-downtime deployment, rolling out new versions without disrupting users.


# Step 6: Logging and Monitoring

Configure CloudWatch Logs for real-time logging and error tracking.
Set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify of high error rates, latency, or other anomalies.
Use AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing to diagnose performance issues.
